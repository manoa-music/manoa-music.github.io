## Community Feedback

* Finn Gardener (UH Student): “I am very excited for what's to come from Manoa Music. Although the design of the website and logo could be better in my opinion. I like the functionality it provides to the UH musicians. My favorite feature was how spotify, soundcloud, and youtube were incorporated so I can check out music from my fellow classmates.”
