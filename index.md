## Overview

Manoa Music plans to tackle a problem for UH students with muscial talents. As it can be difficult for students to find others with similar musical tastes, talents, and capabilities. 

Technologies we plan on using for "Manoa Music":

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.
